    "The process of plant transpiration propels the exchange of water and energy between the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere (G. G. Katul et al., 2012). This phenomenon significantly impacts the uptake of carbon by ecosystem and also plays a pivotal role in determining how rainfall infiltrates into the soil and the moisture profile dynamic. In fact, the interaction between soil evaporation and plant transpiration is not merely a sum of physical processes, but is influenced by feedback mechanisms. As plants transpire, they create a suction that draws moisture from the soil into their root systems, thereby influencing the rate of soil evaporation. Conversely, soil evaporation can reduce the available moisture for plant roots, impacting their ability to transpire effectively. This dynamic coupling shapes the moisture profile within the soil, significantly changing the overall water availability for the soil and vegetation and for the entire hydrological cycle.\n",

    "`GEOET` (v1.5.9), the GEOframe EvapoTranspiration model suite, serves as a versatile tool for simulating evapotranspiration (ET) across various environmental conditions. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the understanding and modeling of ET processes by implementing multiple formulations. \n",
    "The software's high-level functionalities include a modular framework that allows users to select from a variety of ET models tailored to their specific needs and available data. This flexibility enhances comparative analysis of different modeling approaches, empowering users to evaluate the performance of various parameterizations in a unified environment. "

    "\n",
    "**GEOET Refactoring:** The evapotranspiration component, GEOET, was developed as part of [Concetta D'Amato's Ph.D. work](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2024/04/exploring-soil-plant-atmosphere.html) and is based on its predecessor, the GEOframe-ETP model (Bottazzi, 2020; Bottazzi et al., 2021). The original source code for GEOframe-ETP is available [here](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/ETP). Both GEOframe-ETP and GEOET simulate evapotranspiration using three different models: the **Priestley-Taylor** model (Priestley and Taylor, 1972), the **Penman-Monteith FAO** model (Allen et al., 1998), and the **GEOframe-Prospero** model (Bottazzi, 2020; Bottazzi et al., 2021). In addition, GEOET implements a complex model **Transpiration Budget** that calculates the energy balance at the canopy scale, as described in [D'Amato 2024](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2024/04/exploring-soil-plant-atmosphere.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition from GEOframe-ETP to GEOET involved significant refactoring at both the design and algorithmic levels, as illustrated in the figure below. This reorganization and re-engineering of the software were essential to support multiple evapotranspiration physics options, introduce a dedicated component for calculating the stress factor applicable across all evapotranspiration models, and facilitate connections between the ET components and other model components, particularly enabling integration with [WHETGEO](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/15/75/2022/gmd-15-75-2022.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The new code version allows for individual analysis of the physical processes of evapotranspiration and their interaction with infiltration processes. As shown in the figure, all evapotranspiration models have been organized into packages of classes, each assigned specific tasks. Moreover, depending on the model’s complexity, each package is hierarchically structured into additional packages and classes. Each class is designed to perform a singular task and aims to be as self-contained as possible. This design approach not only ensures the independent operation of each class but also minimizes the user’s need to provide inputs or information unrelated to the specific model in use.\n",

    "`GEOET` (v1.5.9) (GEOframe EvapoTranspiration) is a suite of models that is designed to implement different formulations of ET, from the simplest Priestley-Taylor (PT) formula (Priestley and Taylor, 1972) to the complex computation of the energy budget at the canopy scale described in [D’Amato 2024](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2024/04/exploring-soil-plant-atmosphere.html). Currently, GEOET besides PT, the Penman-Monteith FAO model (Allen et al., 1998, PM-FAO) and the GEOframe-Prospero model(Bottazzi, 2020; Bottazzi et al., 2021) implements some more complex models, which include a more complex treatment of plants hydraulics, are under implementation according to D’Amato and Rigon (2024). \n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of multiple models for calculating evapotranspiration within a unified framework enables a comprehensive comparison of models and parameterizations, as they can leverage common auxiliary components. This possibility also caters to user requirements by offering a selection of modeling approaches with varying complexities, empowering users to choose based on their specific needs and available data. GEOET is also designed to implement multiple water and environmental stress functions, which at present, are based on the Jarvis model (Macfarlane et al., 2004) and the Medlyn stomatal conductance model (Medlyn et al., 2011, Ball et al., 1987, Lin et al., 2015). GEOET also models the growth and behavior of roots as functionally to understand the interactions between soil and plants in the generation of ET.\n"
